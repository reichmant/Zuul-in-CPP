# Zuul in C++
## Convert of a text based game in Java -> C++
Originally a project for a Data Structures & Algorithms class. Used to learn C++ from a project we already did in Java.

In this case, to make a fair starting ground for all students, the entire class cloned an [existing project](https://github.com/ryanseys/zuul).

# Usage
Just run from commmand line. This was a one-off project, so little documentation will be provided (especially as this message was written years after the original assignment was graded).

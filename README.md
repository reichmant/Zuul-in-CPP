+# Zuul in C++
+## Text based game in Java
+Originally a project for a Data Structures & Algorithms class. Used to learn C++ from a project we already did in Java.
+
+In this case, to make a fair starting ground for all students, the entire class cloned an [existing project](https://github.com/ryanseys/zuul).
+
+# Usage
+Just run from commmand line. This was a one-off project, so little documentation will be provided (especially as this message was written years after the original assignment was graded).

The objective of this experiment was to determine the identity of Unknown Compund #//.

This was done by first taking the initial mass measurements of the crucible, crucible cover, and approximately .5g sample of the unknown compound. Once, these initial masses were determined we put the cricible with the 



compound inside and the cover slightly ajarm gently over the Bunsen burner for 2 minutes. We then applied an intense flame for another 2 minutes to ensure the reaction had full taken place. After letting the crucible and its contents cool for 10 minutes we took another measurement of mass. From this, we are easily able to determine if a significant weight fluctuation had occurred.
